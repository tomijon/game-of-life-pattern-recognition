# Pattern Recognition in Conways Game of Life
The project searches for specific patterns in Conways Game of Life.
These include blocks, beehives, blinkers, toads, gliders and light-weight spaceships.
The algorithm uses a graph type structure for the game updates and shape matching which makes it super fast!

### Issues
Currently, the clear console escape sequence only works in bash terminals. Personally, I run it using git bash. However,
it still works in cmd / powershell except your console will be flooded.
